# Loggers-BufferReader-Exceptions
* BufferReader and InputStreamReader for reading user input
* Logger for writing logs to a file (App.log)
* FileHandler in static init block for creating App.log file once program is started
* SimpleFormatter for converting logs from XML to readable text
* Thread.sleep(100) to stop program from executing for 100 milliseconds

P.S.
Here I added App.log file to GitHub, but in real projects it's added to gitignore by default
